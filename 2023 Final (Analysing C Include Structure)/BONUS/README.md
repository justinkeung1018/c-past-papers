One of only two submissions to have passed all test cases except one (when `main.c` has no includes). Was awarded runner-up for the C Final Test Bonus Prize due to memory leaks, as well as a copy of the 20th anniversary edition of The Pragmatic Programmer.

## Original description
If you decide to attempt this bonus challenge (remember: there
are NO MARKS FOR IT), then work in this subdirectory.  Make sure that
all your up to date solutions to Tasks 1..4 are in the parent directory,
and that you have compiled everything in that parent directory.

To compile your code here, simply use cb.  The .cbuild file already knows
to add -I.. (to find all parental .h files) and to link in the important
../*.o object files.
